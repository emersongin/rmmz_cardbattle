I) Brief review on card battles

When you first begin the game, what you should do is get a folder.
It allows you to store cards. The folder can be obtained in the yellow 
cruiser, in Asuka city. Card battles aren't hard. The best way to win is 
by doing combos. Combos can be done when you have 3 of the same digimon on
the field. Also rookies do not need any S-energy to be summon, but as for
other levels they do. Champion need's 1 S-energy, ultimate 2, and mega 3.
These energies are listed on the bottom when you card battle. If you want
to find out more information, talk to the 2 people in yellow cruiser. Talk
to the kid with the red shirt and the guy in the counter. Booster can be
obtained from card battle. The battler gives you booster that has an "a" at
the end of the number. You can also fight cardmon for booster, which has
a "b" after the number. You can either use your kick boot to knock cardmon
out of the tree or fish them out.


II) My own opinion

It is best if you make your deck with the same colored energy. It is best if
your deck is full of red digimons, blue, etc. This way when when you want to
summon a high level digimon, it would make it a lot easier. Aside of that I
recommend not putting that many mega digimon in your deck. This is because
they cannot do combo. One more thing, it is wise to stock up program
cards, such as freeze bug. Program cards can help out a lot, especially
when fighting strong card player.


III) All 314 card list

Here is a list of all the cards. The left side shows a list of all cards,
while the number on the far right shows which booster they can obtain. 
I think this will make things a lot easier. 15 of the cards can only be 
obtain through side quest, and is listed in the secret's section.

IV)	Available boosters and locations

These are a list of booster of where cardmon may be found.
There are other booster as well, which has an "a" at the end.
Those boosters, you get them from trainers. I will not list        
The trainer's since there Level and booster changes when 
You get the trophy from king divermon. Plus, if I were to 
List them, I will need to start another new game. Which will
take another week to do.

ASS= asuka server
AMS= Amaterasu server
         
1b- can be found in east sector. Both fishing and kicking trees (ASS)
2b- found in south sector by fishing (ASS)
3b- kick trees in kicking forest, east sector. (ASS)
4b- kick trees in west sector (ASS)
5b- fish in west sector (ASS)
6b- Kick trees in east sector, except in kicking forest (AMS)
7b- Found by fishing in east sector (AMS)
8b- fish in south sector (AMS)
9b- kick trees in the kicking forest, east sector (AMS)
10b- kick trees in south sector (AMS)
11b- Kick trees in North sector (ASS)
12b- fish in North sector (ASS)
13b- fish in west sector (AMS)
14b- kick trees in both west and north sector (AMS)
15b- fish in north sector (AMS)

R-01 these booster are rarely dropped by fishing cardmon that has 
booster 1b-3b (I think)
R-02 these booster are rarely dropped by fishing cardmon that has 
booster 4b-6b (I think)
R-03 these booster are rarely dropped by fishing cardmon that has 
booster 7b-11b (I think)
R-04 these booster are rarely dropped by fishing cardmon that has 
booster 11b-13b (I think)
R-05 these booster are rarely dropped by fishing cardmon that has 
booster 14b and 15b


V)	sidequest

Not much to say here but you can get trophy in both server. To do so you 
must battle both king divermon and king etemon. There really isn't much to
say about the divermon's. As for king etemon, once you reach the 4th etemon,
he will ask you to get his mic back. He tell's you that a BK agumon has it.
The BK agumon that stole etemon's mic is in south sector (asuka server). 
The hole is near where you first met Zanbamon in Jungle grave. After 
beating him in card battle, he tell's you that BK king has it. BK king is 
located in the Amaterasu server. The hole which you have to dug is in central 
park. The hole is near the entrance of plug cape. Once you meet him and beat 
him in card battle, he gives you the mic. Now that everything is set, it's 
time
to go return the mic, and get your trophy.
**note, the hole is in central park not plug cape. I am just giving a 
description. It is near Panjyamon's gym**


VI)	Secret's on legendary (rare) cards
These are cards given by BK agumon and numemon's. They are hidden in 
the circuit board which you have to card battle them. These cards are
one of a kind. Meaning you can only get one throughout the whole entire
game. I'm not the one who found them all, i only found 3. Couple of 
my friends in the message board founded the others. See the credit 
section to see who found what.

------------------BK Agumon-----------------------

Noise Desert(ASS) - R-B1 and Fortune Gate

Freeze Mountain (ASS) - R-B2 and Anti-Power
--freeze mnt, high top hole, hole next to rosemonII--

Freeze mountain(AMS)- R-B3 and Misery Gate
--Similar to where you got your anti-power but different server.--

Plug Cape (AMS) - R-B4 and Delete Matrix
--Hole near the entrance, below the top hole at the highest point.--

South Badlands(ASS) - R-B5 and Desired Access 
--The hole is in the middle I think--

--------------------Numemons--------------------

North Badland W (AMS) - R-B1 and Marine Angemon
--entered the hole in Am Plug cape (high hole)--

Boot Mountain (AMS) - R-B2 and SaberLeomon
--the hole at the left in Amaterasu Boot Mountain, you'll need to climb 
up then jump down once at the left, inside there's an Agumon who tell 
you that this hole only connected to Amaterasu Server, go west from 
him, continue north and you'll find the Numemon w/ King of the Forest 
folder...--

 Freeze Mountain (ASS) - R-B3 RosemonII 
--freeze mnt, high top hole--

Freeze mountain(AMS) - R-B4 and Gryphonmon
--same as rosemon,freeze mnt, high top hole. --

Snow Mountain (ASS) - R-B5 and Creepymon 
--West of the inn..in snow mnt-


       -----------Tamers'-All are in Asuka Server------------

**note** Throughout the whole entire game, you can only card battle them twice.
First time you card battle them is after you get the trophy from divermob king.
The second time they card battle you will be near the end of the game. This 
requires your charmisa to be very high. Therefore i recommend you all to card
battle them once everyone in AM Server has become normal. Due to this you can 
now go to the black market in AM City and buy charmisa chips to raise it's
status. I'm not too sure but there average should be 2500 or higher. Well
once you have that requirement go to yellow cruiser in AM server and see
if the people there will card battle you. If they happen to card battle
you then that means the ones with the other 5 legendary cards will as well.



1)Tamer Mitch: Gives you Wield Aura. He is in Wire Forest. B-04a
2)Tamer Bob: Gives you Tidal Wave. He is in Kicking Forest. B-05a
3)Tamer Jessica:Gives you Volcanic Cannon. She is in Tranquil Swamp.B-06a
4)Tamer Nakano: Gives you Sacred Spear. He is in Mirage Tower. B-09a
5)Tamer Mitaka: Gives you Darkness Gale. He is in Kulon Pit. B-10a



VII)	My card deck 

Here I will give an example of some of my fellow friends deck. I will of 
course rate it too. I am not too good at it but will try my best. If 
anyone in the board wanted me to rate there deck, tell me.

This is my deck:
My 3 decks don't have much digimon since I have control parts. Aside of
that I can use some of the program cards to discard his/her cards. My 
max combo that I did was over 400/400. I can rate you deck if you want 
me too. I am no expert, but I can give few comments.

-------------------Tamer Dbzlean´s Deck---------------------

Hmm well I think this is an unbalance deck. This is because the 
digimon cards has different colors. Since you have 3 green 
force. I recommed building a deck with just green digimon cards.

Omnidevimon Deck
--------------------
2 Gold Aura
3 Freeze bug
3 Green Force
1 Beasty Energy
1 Deceive Cloak
2 Vicius hacking
3 Summon Devimon
1 Delete Matrix
1 Fortune Gate
1 Mistery Gate
1 Desire Access
2 Absolute barrier
3 Charge terminal
1 Digimon Charge
1 Program Charge
3 Omnimons
3 W. Garurumons
4 Devimons
3 BK Imperialdramon

----------------Tamer Yellow13 deck-----------------

Nice deck. But if you have 2 armageddemon, then I recommend replace it
with the diaboromon card. Also if you have any summon devimon card, I
would put few in the deck. This is because when you use summon 
devimon, you will not lose S-energy. Update your deck by adding control
parts too, If you have them. And replace it with the 2 megagargomon. 
Also put creepymon in the deck since it's very useful. It almost always
have 99/99 but depends on the number of discard cards in the bin.

Hmm I recommed having just white digimon cards, rather than a 
mix of 2. And replace megaGargomon and some other card such 
as whamon with summon angemon.

Nice deck. I think it's one of the best I've seen so far. But if your
digimon can cream your enemies' deck easily then I don't think it's 
necessary to have 2 absolute barriers. I rather have 4-charge terminal.
Also it really isn't necessary to have that many mega's in your deck 
since they can't do combo. I think you should put 4 paildramon.

Another good one, I would keep 2 armageddemon rather than 4. 
Also take out 2 devimon and the 2 armageddemon and replace it with 4 
ultimate. I recommend myotismon.
